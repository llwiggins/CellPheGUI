# Making use of the CellPhe GUI
In future, CellPhe will be hosted online so that users can follow a URL to make use of the GUI. 

For now, the app.R file can be downloaded and opened in the R Studio IDE. "Run app" can then be selected to open the GUI either in R Studio or externally dependent on the users' selection.
